Apple Swift Language Playground
===============================

This repo provides space for sharing interesting tidbits found while trying out Apple's new Swift programming language.

Examples are grouped by loosely defined categories represented by folders. To try them out, you can just paste the
code into a new Xcode 6 beta Playground.
