Apple Swift Language Playground
===============================

This repo provides space for sharing intersting tidbits found while trying out Apple's new Swift programming language.

Examples are grouped by loosly defined categories represented by folders. To try them out, you can just paste the
code into a new Xcode 6 beta Playground.

## Table of Contents

### Tutorial

This folder contains a small walkthrough through the syntax and features of the language aimed at people who already have development experience in other languages.

### Collection Types

`ArrayCopyingBehavior.swift`  
An example of -- for most developers of other languages -- odd array copying behavior.
